[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)


## Overview
In this project, the skills and knowledge of basic Python and data engineering principles acquired throughout the course will be applied. The task involves working with real-world data to perform Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) operations. The project scenario involves a multi-national firm that requires data engineering services to access, process, and transform data according to specific requirements.


## Data Source
The initial step is to compile a list of the top 10 largest banks in the world by market capitalization in billion USD. This data will be transformed into three additional currencies: GBP, EUR, and INR, using exchange rates provided in a CSV file. The transformed data will be saved locally in a CSV format and loaded into a database table. This allows managers from different countries to query the database and view market capitalization values in their local currency.
